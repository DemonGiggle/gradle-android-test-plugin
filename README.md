Gradle Android Unit Testing Plugin
==================================

A Gradle plugin which enables good 'ol fashioned unit tests for Android builds.


Testing
-------

 1. Run `./gradlew install` in the root. This will build the plugin and install it into a local Maven
    repository.
 2. In the `example/` folder, run `../gradlew clean check` to build and run the unit tests.
 3. Open `example/build/test-reports/index.html` in the browser.
